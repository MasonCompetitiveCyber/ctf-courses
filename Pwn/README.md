## Introduction

In this course, we are going to be discussing the basics of exploit development. We are specifically going to be focusing on binary exploitation techniques such as buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, and other such concepts that are common in CTF challenges. This is by no means an exhaustive list of all possible vulnerabilities; this course is just here to help you get started on your exploit development journey. You should have a good understanding of C and x86-64 assembly before proceeding, and you should also already know how to use a debugger such as [GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/).
