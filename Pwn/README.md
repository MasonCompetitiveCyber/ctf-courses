## Introduction

These courses discuss the basics of exploit development. They are specifically going to be focusing on low-level binary exploitation techniques such as buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, and other such concepts that are common in CTF challenges. These courses are by no means an exhaustive list of all possible vulnerabilities; they are just here to help you get started on your exploit development journey. You should have a good understanding of C and x86-64 assembly before proceeding, and you should also be prepared to use a debugger such as [GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/). Some knowledge of reverse engineering techniques would also be good to know.
