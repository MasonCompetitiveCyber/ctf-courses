# Introduction
### `./Background`
Steganography is the art of concealing information within something inocuous, so those who are not meant to see it would not know it is even there. 

The communication of secret information has been around for as long as humanity, and the methods of doing so have been constantly evolving. Usually, one would think of the transmission of secrets as a verbal act, such as whispering into a confidant’s ear or making sure you are alone before telling your secrets. But what if the two people can not be in close physical proximity? To address this issue, two main solutions were created: cryptography and steganography. The difference between them is that cryptography aims at concealing the *meaning* of a message while steganography aims to hide the *existence* of the message itself. To demonstrate this, let us use the secret message *`attack at dawn.`* One simple method of cryptography is called the Caesar Cipher, which takes a letter and shifts it down the alphabet a certain amount. If we set the shift at 13 letters, `“a”` becomes `“n”`, `“b”` becomes `“o”`, and so on. If we do this to every letter in our secret message, *`attack at dawn`* becomes *`nggnpx ng qnja`* As we can see, the meaning of the initial message has been concealed (only to a certain degree, as it can be deciphered), but not the existence of the message itself. If we want to conceal the *existence* of this message, we would use methods of steganography, such invisible ink. If we write *`attack at dawn`* with invisible ink on some document and someone intercepts it, they will not know that the document contains some sort of secret message. If the message gets to the intended receiver, they would know they must heat the paper to reveal the secret message written in invisible ink.

The word “steganography” comes from the Greek roots “steganos” and “-graphy” which together mean “covered writing.” Some of the oldest forms of steganography date back to the Greeks and Spartans, such as tattooing a message on a slave’s head and waiting for their hair to grow back or covering a message with a fresh layer of wax. As technology improved, so did the methods of concealing information, which we will discuss in this course.

### `./Types-Of-Steganography`

There are several types of steganography, which are usually sorted by the medium in which the secret information is concealed. The main types of steganography are:
- image
- audio
- video
- text
- network

Image steg involves hiding information inside of another image, known as the "cover image." Text steg involves hiding informatin within a text file or some other body of text. Video and image steg are self-explanatory. Finally, network steg, also known as "protocol steganography", involves hiding information within network traffic.  We will discuss the basics of each type of steganography in this course.
